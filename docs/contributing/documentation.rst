Contributing to the distribution documentation
==============================================

What is the documentation for?
------------------------------

The iGEM distribution documentation (docs) are a set of pages that serve to both explain things to new users/contributors to the distribution and also serve as a point of reference and 'single source of truth' for those who are already using/contributing.
As such, we see *anything* that *anyone* doesn't understand about the distribution, or any standard procedure that isn't written down as a 'bug' in our documentation, no matter how small.
In fact, the smaller it is the more likely it is that other people have the same question!
We therefore welcome any contributions to the documentation, in the first instance by raising an issue with 'documentation' and 'enhancement'/'bug' tags but then, if possible, by working with us to improve the docs.
